    <h2>Eco‑Friendly Cellar Practices</h2>
    <p>A thoughtfully designed wine cellar protects your bottles and the environment. Here are some tips to build and maintain a sustainable cellar:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Efficient insulation:</strong> Properly insulate walls and doors to reduce the energy required for cooling. High‑quality insulation helps maintain a stable temperature and humidity.</li>
      <li><strong>Energy‑efficient cooling:</strong> Choose cooling units with high energy ratings and consider models that use eco‑friendly refrigerants. Regular maintenance keeps them running efficiently.</li>
      <li><strong>LED lighting:</strong> Use LED lights which emit minimal heat and consume less power than incandescent bulbs. Motion sensors or timers help ensure lights are off when not needed.</li>
      <li><strong>Reclaimed and natural materials:</strong> Build racks and shelving from reclaimed wood or sustainably sourced materials. Avoid plastics and chemicals that could off‑gas near your wines.</li>
      <li><strong>Monitor conditions smartly:</strong> Employ smart sensors to track temperature and humidity. Automated alerts can notify you if conditions drift outside the ideal range, helping you respond quickly.</li>
      <li><strong>Reduce waste:</strong> Repurpose wine crates, bottles and corks creatively, or recycle them properly. Supporting wineries with sustainable practices can also make a difference.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Implementing these practices not only safeguards your collection but also reduces your environmental footprint, letting you enjoy your wines with peace of mind.</p>
